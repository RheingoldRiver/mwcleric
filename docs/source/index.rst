mwcleric Documentation
===========================================

MediaWiki Client Library for Editing and Revision In Code is a collection of tools in Python for editing & querying MediaWiki wikis, including a few tools specialized for the Fandom wiki farm.

The library can be installed from PyPI using pip:

``pip install mwcleric``

If you're using PyCharm, your code may be executing in a venv; press alt+F12 and use PyCharm's own terminal to install to that environment.
